### Elastic Common Schema (ECS)

# A specification of common fields and how they should be mapped
# Before ECS, there was no cohesion between field names
# Ingesting logs from nginx would give different names than Apache
# ECS means that common fields are named the same thing

#       * E.g @timestamp

# In ECS, documents are referred as EVENTS

# Monstly used for standard events - webserver logs, OS metrics, geospatial data.
# You should try to standard your data strucures with ECS.
